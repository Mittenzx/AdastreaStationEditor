# Modular Station Designer for Adastrea

A visual station builder plugin for Unreal Engine that enables drag-and-drop modular station construction with connection points, snapping, and direct export to Adastrea's editor.

## Overview

This plugin provides a streamlined workflow for designing space stations in the Adastrea project. Instead of manually placing and positioning modules in the Unreal Editor, designers can use an intuitive visual tool to:

- **Drag and drop** station modules from a palette
- **Connect modules** automatically with intelligent snapping
- **Validate designs** to ensure all requirements are met
- **Export directly** to Adastrea-compatible Blueprint actors

### Key Features

- 🎯 **Intuitive Interface**: Visual 3D workspace with drag-and-drop module placement
- 🔌 **Smart Connections**: Automatic snapping and validation of module connections
- ✅ **Built-in Validation**: Check for required modules, power balance, and connectivity
- 📦 **Direct Export**: Generate Blueprint actors ready for use in Adastrea
- 💾 **Save/Load**: Preserve designs for later editing
- 🚀 **Fast Workflow**: Create functional stations 5-10x faster than manual placement

## Target Users

- **Level Designers** building space stations for Adastrea
- **Content Creators** designing custom station layouts
- **Game Developers** prototyping station configurations

## System Requirements

- **Unreal Engine**: 5.6 (primary), 5.4+ (minimum)
- **Platform**: Windows (primary), Mac/Linux (optional)
- **Dependencies**: Adastrea project modules

## Quick Start

> **Note**: This plugin is currently in development. The following instructions will be available once the plugin reaches MVP stage.

1. Clone this repository into your Unreal Engine plugins directory
2. Open your Adastrea project
3. Enable the "Modular Station Designer" plugin
4. Access the tool from Tools menu → Station Builder

## Project Status
